# Saving your configuration changes

To save any configuration changes you make when using the products in the stack, you need to set up a local Docker volume to persist state and data for the stack. If you don't do this, whenever you bring the stack down your configuration changes will be lost.

You'll mount a Docker volume location to the Docker `/opt/out` directory for the container. The location must be to a directory you've not already created. Our Docker containers use the `/opt/out` directory to store application data.

> Make sure the local directory is not already created. Docker needs to create this directory for the mount to `/opt/out`.

You can mount a Docker volume for containers in a stack or for standalone containers.

## Bind mounting for a stack

1. Add a `volumes` section under the container entry for each product in the `docker-compose.yaml` file you're using for the stack.
2. Under the `volumes` section, add a location to persist your data. For example:

   ```yaml
   pingfederate:
   .
   .
   .
   volumes:
    - /tmp/compose/pingfederate_1:/opt/out
   ```

3. In the `environment` section, comment out the `SERVER_PROFILE_PATH` setting. The container will then use your `volumes` entry to supply the product state and data, including your configuration changes.

   When the container starts, this will mount `/tmp/compose/pingfederate_1` to the `/opt/out` directory in the container. You're also able to view the product logs and data in the `/tmp/compose/pingfederate_1` directory.

4. Repeat this process for the remaining container entries in the stack.

## Bind mounting for a standalone container

* Add a `volume` entry to the `docker run` command:

  ```bash
  docker run \
      --name pingfederate \
      --volume <local-path>:/opt/out
      pingidentity/pingfederate:edge
  ```
